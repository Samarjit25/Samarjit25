# 👋 Hey, I'm Samarjit

Final year B.Tech student at NIT Silchar, diving deep into Electronics and Communication Engineering by day and geeking out over dev, machine learning, and UI/UX by night. I like learning random cool stuff, building things that (hopefully) work, and turning ideas into something you can actually click on. Not a fan of comfort zones, so I keep exploring and experimenting while keeping things interesting.
I work mostly with JavaScript/TypeScript and love building with the MERN stack. I'm also exploring backend architecture, developer experience, and building useful tools for the web. When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me jamming to music or brainstorming hackathon ideas.
